An analysis notebook was created to better understand the future direction and risk of the Japanese yen versus the US dollar using various time series forecasting methods.  Historical quotes were pulled from the Quandl API.  Time-Series decomposition was done using the Hodrick-Prescott filter and various moving averages.  Seasonal effects were calculated by time-series regression using ARMA and ARIMA models.  Volatility forecasting was calculated using GARCH and EGARCH models.
